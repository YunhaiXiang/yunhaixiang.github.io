Here’s a test animation I made demonstrating the nine point circle and part of Feuerbach’s theorem. It should be noted that Feuerbach’s Theorem also tells us that the nine point circle of a triangle is tangent to the three excircles of that triangle, but I did not include that in the video.","link":"/archives/e3b6140a/"},{"title":"The Smith Determinant","text":"Here’s a curious identity I ran across on AoPS: the determinant of an \\(n\\times n\\) matrix where the \\((i,j)\\) entries is \\(\\gcd(i,j)\\) happends to be the product of the Euler totient values from \\(1\\) to \\(n\\). Theorem (Smith’s Determinant).$$\\det\\begin{pmatrix}\\gcd(1,1)&amp;\\gcd(1,2)&amp;\\cdots&amp;\\gcd(1,n)\\\\\\gcd(2,1)&amp;\\gcd(2,2)&amp;\\cdots&amp;\\gcd(2,n)\\\\\\vdots &amp; \\vdots &amp; \\ddots &amp;\\vdots\\\\\\gcd(n,1)&amp;\\gcd(n,2)&amp;\\cdots&amp;\\gcd(n,n)\\end{pmatrix}=\\prod_{m=1}^n\\varphi(m)$$where \\(\\varphi(\\cdot)\\) is the Euler totient function. The proof of this result is surprisingly simple: to describe it briefly, multiply the first row by \\(-1\\) and add it to the \\(2,3,4,…,n\\) rows, multiply the second row by \\(-1\\) and add it to the \\(2,4,6,…\\) rows, multiply the third row by \\(-1\\) and add it to the \\(3,6,9,…\\) rows, and so on. Then use of the identity \\(\\sum_{d\\mid n}\\varphi(d)=n\\) to simplify. Another method is to use of UD decomposition, decomposing the original matrix into$$\\begin{pmatrix}\\varphi(1)&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\cdots\\\\\\varphi(1)&amp;\\varphi(2)&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\cdots\\\\\\varphi(1)&amp;0&amp;\\varphi(3)&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\cdots\\\\\\varphi(1)&amp;\\varphi(2)&amp;0&amp;\\varphi(4)&amp;0&amp;\\cdots\\\\\\varphi(1)&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\varphi(5)&amp;\\cdots\\\\\\vdots&amp;\\vdots&amp;\\vdots&amp;\\vdots&amp;\\vdots&amp;\\ddots\\\\\\end{pmatrix}\\begin{pmatrix}1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;1&amp;\\cdots\\\\0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;\\cdots\\\\0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;0&amp;\\cdots\\\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;0&amp;\\cdots\\\\0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;0&amp;1&amp;\\cdots\\\\\\vdots&amp;\\vdots&amp;\\vdots&amp;\\vdots&amp;\\vdots&amp;\\ddots\\\\\\end{pmatrix}$$And hence by the multiplicative property of determinants, we have our desired result.","link":"/archives/f5f14030/"},{"title":"Burnside's Lemma and Polya Enumeration Theorem","text":"Burnside’s lemma is a lemma of elementary group theory that is very useful in counting, and often seen as an “overkill” trick in math competitions. Intuitively, Burnside’s lemma counts the number of arrangements or permutations of an object if some of its symmetries are considered identical. For example, Example 1. How many distinct colorings can be obtained with \\(6\\) different colors to color the faces of a cube? Two configurations are considered identical if one can be obtained from the other through rotation. SolutionThere are \\(30\\) distinct colorings. Consider the group of rotations of a cube \\(G\\) acting on \\(\\mathrm{S}_6\\), there are \\(3\\times 3=9\\) rotations about opposite faces, \\(6\\times 1 = 6\\) rotations about opposite edges, and \\(4\\times 2=8\\) rotations about opposite vertices. Together with the identity rotation we have \\(|G|=9+6+8+1=24\\) (in fact, \\(G\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\mathrm{S}_4 \\)). For \\(g=e\\), we have \\(X^g=X\\), and for \\(g\\ne e\\), we have \\(X^g=\\varnothing\\) since all colors on the faces are different. Hence the number of orbits is$$\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{g\\in G}|X^g|=\\frac{|X|}{|G|}=\\frac{6!}{24}=30$$which means that there are \\(30\\) distinct colorings. To approach such problem, we start with the definitions of orbits, stabilizers, and fixed points in group actions. Definition 1. Let \\(G\\) be a group that acts on \\(X\\), the orbit of a point \\( x\\in X\\) is defined as \\( G\\cdot x=\\{g\\cdot x\\mid g\\in G\\} \\), the stabilizer of a point \\( x\\in X\\) is defined as \\( G_x =\\{g\\in G\\mid g\\cdot x=x\\} \\), and the fixed points of \\(g\\in G\\) in \\(X\\) is the set \\( X^g=\\{x\\in X\\mid g\\cdot x=x\\} \\). Note that for \\(x,y\\in X\\), either the orbits \\(G\\cdot x=G\\cdot y\\) or \\((G\\cdot x)\\cap (G\\cdot y)=\\varnothing \\). This is an easy result since if \\(a\\in (G\\cdot x)\\cap (G\\cdot y)\\) then \\(a=g_1\\cdot x=g_2\\cdot y\\), for some \\(g_1,g_2\\in G\\), so \\(x=g_1^{-1}g_2\\cdot y\\) and \\(y=g_2^{-1}g_1\\cdot x\\), hence \\((G\\cdot x)\\subseteq (G\\cdot y)\\) and \\((G\\cdot y)\\subseteq (G\\cdot x)\\). Also, consider the map \\(\\varphi:G/G_x\\rightarrow G\\cdot x\\) defined by \\(\\varphi(gG_x)=g\\cdot x\\). We can easily see that \\(\\varphi\\) is an isomorphism, which gives us \\(|G\\cdot x|=\\left[G:G_x\\right]\\), also known as the orbit-stabilizer theorem. Theorem 1 (Burnside’s Lemma). Consider a group \\(G\\) acting on a set \\(X\\), then the number of distinct orbits is$$\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{g\\in G}|X^g|$$ProofLet \\(S=\\{(g,x)\\in G\\times X\\mid g\\cdot x= x\\}\\), we have$$|S|=\\sum_{g\\in G}|X^g|$$Let \\(B\\) be the set of orbits, and by the orbit-stabilizer theorem,$$|S|=\\sum_{x\\in X}|G_x|=|G|\\sum_{x\\in X}\\frac{1}{|G\\cdot x|}=|G|\\sum_{A\\in B}\\sum_{a\\in A}\\frac{1}{|A|}=|G|\\sum_{A\\in B}1=|G||B|$$And we are done. Excercise 1. (Easy) How many colorings are there to color the four edges of a square using \\(n\\) colors? Two configurations are considered identical if one can be obtained from the other through reflections and rotations. (USAMTS 2008) \\(27\\) cubes with \\(25\\) black cubes and \\(2\\) white cubes are assembled to form a \\(3\\times 3\\times 3\\) large cube. How many identical large cubes can be formed?

(Moderate) A \\(k\\)-ary necklace of length \\(n\\) is a string of \\(n\\) beads each one of \\(k\\) colors, where rotations are considered equivalent. Find the number of \\(k\\)-ary necklaces of length \\(p\\) where \\(p\\) is prime, and prove that the number of different \\(k\\)-ary necklaces of length \\(n\\) is$$N_k(n)=\\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{d\\mid n}k^d\\varphi\\left(\\frac{n}{d}\\right)$$ A \\(k\\)-ary bracelet of length \\(n\\) is a string of \\(n\\) beads each one of \\(k\\) colors, where rotations and reflections are considered equivalent.

Some of them use clever substitutions, others exploit the symmetry of the integrand, or make use of some devilishly sly maneuvers such as differentiating under the integral sign. For a quick appetizer, try evaluate$$\\int_0^\\pi\\ln(a^2-2a\\cos x+1)\\,\\mathrm d x$$where \\(a&gt;0\\). This is one of my favorite integrals. We will see later in this post that this integral can be solved by at least five different methods, which is simply astounding! I should clearify that not all of these tricks are meant to be pragmatic, and the vast majority of tricks in this collection are for recreational mathematics. The integral tricks in this collection mainly comes from past papers of math olympiads such as the Putnam, PUMaC, HMMT and SMT, as well as online math communities like Math Stack Exchange and Art of Problem Solving. For further reading, I really recommend the book Inside Interesting Integrals by Paul J. Nahin, who does a better job of summarizing integral tricks than I do. Exploiting the Symmetry of the IntegrandIn many cases, mathematics tends to reward you when you respect its symmetry, and when it comes to milking integrals, sometimes we can exploit the hidden symmetries in the integrand and solve the integral surprisingly quickly. Case in point, try the following example. $$\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\frac{\\cos x}{e^{\\sin^3 x}+1}\\,\\mathrm dx$$As a hint, observe that the interval of integration is symmetric, but the integrand is not an odd function. Also note that the denominator is an even function and \\(\\sin^3 x\\) is odd. Try the substitution \\(u=-x\\) and see if you can simplify the integrand by getting rid of the denominator. SolutionBy symmetry or the substitution \\(u=-x\\), we can easily obtain$$I=-\\int_{\\pi/4}^{-\\pi/4}\\frac{\\cos (-u)}{e^{-\\sin^3 u}+1}\\,\\mathrm du=\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\frac{\\cos x}{e^{-\\sin^3 x}+1}\\,\\mathrm dx$$Note that \\(u\\) is merely a dummy variable, so we can change it to \\(x\\). Therefore,$$\\begin{aligned}2I&amp;=\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\left(\\frac{\\cos x}{e^{\\sin^3 x}+1}+\\frac{\\cos x}{e^{-\\sin^3 x}+1}\\right)\\,\\mathrm dx\\\\&amp;=\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\left(\\frac{\\cos x}{e^{\\sin^3 x}+1}+\\frac{e^{\\sin^3x}\\cos x}{1+e^{\\sin^{3}x}}\\right)\\,\\mathrm dx\\\\&amp;=\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\frac{(1+e^{\\sin^3x})\\cos x}{1+e^{\\sin^3x}}\\,\\mathrm dx\\\\&amp;=\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\cos x\\,\\mathrm dx\\\\&amp;=\\sqrt{2}\\end{aligned}$$Therefore \\(I=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). Generalizing the technique we have the following theorem. Theorem 1. For \\(a,b\\in\\mathbf{R}\\) and \\(f\\) integrable on \\([a,b]\\)$$\\int_a^bf(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x=\\int_a^bf(a+b-x)\\,\\mathrm dx=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{a}^b\\left(f(x)+f(a+b-x)\\right)\\,\\mathrm dx$$ Excercise 1. (Applications of Theorem 1) Evaluate \\(\\displaystyle\\int_0^{\\pi/4}\\ln(1+\\tan x)\\,\\mathrm dx\\) Evaluate \\(\\displaystyle \\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{\\sin x+\\cos x}{1+\\sqrt[5]{\\tan x}}\\,\\mathrm dx\\) Evaluate \\(\\displaystyle \\int_3^7\\frac{\\ln (x+2)}{\\ln (-x^2+10x+24)}\\,\\mathrm dx\\) Evaluate \\(\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi\\frac{x^2}{ 1+\\sin x+\\sqrt{1+\\sin^2x}}\\,\\mathrm dx\\) However, this is not the only form of symmetry we can exploit. Observe, that for a improperly integrable function \\(f\\) over \\((0,\\infty)\\), the integral \\(\\displaystyle\\int_0^\\infty f\\), when using the substitution \\(u=1/x\\) gives us another integral over \\((0,\\infty)\\). Using this property, we can milk some integrals whose integrands have hidden symmetries with respect to inversion. For example, Example 2. Evaluate$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\\ln x}\\,\\mathrm dx$$HintThere are two ways one can go about solving this integral. You can either directly apply the substitution \\(u=1/x\\), or you can first use the fact that \\(\\displaystyle\\int_0^\\infty f=\\int_0^1 f+\\int_1^\\infty f\\) then use the substitution \\(u=1/x\\) on the second integral. SolutionFirst we have$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\\ln x}\\,\\mathrm dx=\\int_0^1\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\\ln x}\\,\\mathrm dx+\\int_1^\\infty\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\\ln x}\\,\\mathrm dx$$By the substitution \\(u=1/x\\),$$\\begin{aligned}\\int_1^\\infty\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\\ln x}\\,\\mathrm dx&amp;=-\\int_1^0\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+u^{-11}}{1+u^{-3}}}{u^2(1+u^{-2})\\ln u^{-1}}\\,\\mathrm du\\\\&amp;=-\\int_0^1\\frac{\\ln u^{-8}\\frac{1+u^{11}}{1+u^{3}}}{(u^2+1)\\ln u}\\,\\mathrm du\\\\&amp;=-\\int_0^1\\frac{-8\\ln u+\\ln\\frac{1+u^{11}}{1+u^{3}}}{(u^2+1)\\ln u}\\,\\mathrm du\\\\&amp;=8\\int_0^1\\frac{1}{u^2+1}\\,\\mathrm du-\\int_0^1\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\\ln x}\\,\\mathrm dx\\end{aligned}$$Therefore,$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\\ln x}\\,\\mathrm dx=8\\int_0^1\\frac{1}{u^2+1}\\,\\mathrm du=2\\pi$$ Theorem 2.
