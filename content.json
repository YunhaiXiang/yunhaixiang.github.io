Intuitively, Burnside’s lemma counts the number of arrangements or permutations of an object if some of its symmetries are considered identical. For example, Example 1. How many distinct colorings can be obtained with \\(6\\) different colors to color the faces of a cube? Two configurations are considered identical if one can be obtained from the other through rotation. SolutionThere are \\(30\\) distinct colorings. Consider the group of rotations of a cube \\(G\\) acting on \\(\\mathrm{S}_6\\), there are \\(3\\times 3=9\\) rotations about opposite faces, \\(6\\times 1 = 6\\) rotations about opposite edges, and \\(4\\times 2=8\\) rotations about opposite vertices. Together with the identity rotation we have \\(|G|=9+6+8+1=24\\) (in fact, \\(G\\) is isomorphic to \\(\\mathrm{S}_4 \\)). For \\(g=e\\), we have \\(X^g=X\\), and for \\(g\\ne e\\), we have \\(X^g=\\varnothing\\) since all colors on the faces are different. Hence the number of orbits is$$\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{g\\in G}|X^g|=\\frac{|X|}{|G|}=\\frac{6!}{24}=30$$which means that there are \\(30\\) distinct colorings. To approach such problem, we start with the definitions of orbits, stabilizers, and fixed points in group actions. Definition 1. Let \\(G\\) be a group that acts on \\(X\\), the orbit of a point \\( x\\in X\\) is defined as \\( G\\cdot x=\\{g\\cdot x\\mid g\\in G\\} \\), the stabilizer of a point \\( x\\in X\\) is defined as \\( G_x =\\{g\\in G\\mid g\\cdot x=x\\} \\), and the fixed points of \\(g\\in G\\) in \\(X\\) is the set \\( X^g=\\{x\\in X\\mid g\\cdot x=x\\} \\). Note that for \\(x,y\\in X\\), either the orbits \\(G\\cdot x=G\\cdot y\\) or \\((G\\cdot x)\\cap (G\\cdot y)=\\varnothing \\). This is an easy result since if \\(a\\in (G\\cdot x)\\cap (G\\cdot y)\\) then \\(a=g_1\\cdot x=g_2\\cdot y\\), for some \\(g_1,g_2\\in G\\), so \\(x=g_1^{-1}g_2\\cdot y\\) and \\(y=g_2^{-1}g_1\\cdot x\\), hence \\((G\\cdot x)\\subseteq (G\\cdot y)\\) and \\((G\\cdot y)\\subseteq (G\\cdot x)\\). Also, consider the map \\(\\varphi:G/G_x\\rightarrow G\\cdot x\\) defined by \\(\\varphi(gG_x)=g\\cdot x\\). We can easily see that \\(\\varphi\\) is an isomorphism, which gives us \\(|G\\cdot x|=\\left[G:G_x\\right]\\), also known as the orbit-stabilizer theorem. Theorem 1 (Burnside’s Lemma). Consider a group \\(G\\) acting on a set \\(X\\), then the number of distinct orbits is$$\\frac{1}{|G|}\\sum_{g\\in G}|X^g|$$ProofLet \\(S=\\{(g,x)\\in G\\times X\\mid g\\cdot x= x\\}\\), we have$$|S|=\\sum_{g\\in G}|X^g|$$Let \\(B\\) be the set of orbits, and by the orbit-stabilizer theorem,$$|S|=\\sum_{x\\in X}|G_x|=|G|\\sum_{x\\in X}\\frac{1}{|G\\cdot x|}=|G|\\sum_{A\\in B}\\sum_{a\\in A}\\frac{1}{|A|}=|G|\\sum_{A\\in B}1=|G||B|$$And we are done.

Some of them use clever substitutions, others exploit the symmetry of the integrand, or make use of some devilishly sly maneuvers such as differentiating under the integral sign. For a quick appetizer, try evaluate$$\\int_0^\\pi\\ln(a^2-2a\\cos x+1)\\,\\mathrm d x$$where \\(a&gt;0\\). This is one of my favorite integrals. We will see later in this post that this integral can be solved by at least five different methods, which is simply astounding! I should clearify that not all of these tricks are meant to be pragmatic, and the vast majority of tricks in this collection are for recreational mathematics. The integral tricks in this collection mainly comes from past papers of math olympiads such as the Putnam, PUMaC, HMMT and SMT, as well as online math communities like Math Stack Exchange and Art of Problem Solving. For further reading, I really recommend the book Inside Interesting Integrals by Paul J. Nahin, who does a better job of summarizing integral tricks than I do. Now, without further ado, let’s take a look at the first trick. Exploiting the Symmetry of the IntegrandIn many cases, mathematics tends to reward you when you respect its symmetry, and when it comes to integrals, sometimes we can exploit the hidden symmetries in the integrand. Case in point, consider the following integral, which I really recommend you to solve yourself before reading the next paragraph $$\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\frac{\\cos x}{e^{\\sin^3 x}+1}\\,\\mathrm dx$$Observe that the interval of integration is symmetric, and the numerator of the integrad \\(\\cos x\\) is an even function while \\(\\sin^3 x\\) in the denominator is odd. Hence, if we take mirror the graph of the integrand with respect to the \\(y\\)-axis, the resulting function should only differ by a negative sign before \\(\\sin^3 x\\). And since the interval of integration is symmetric, flipping the integrand about the \\(y\\)-axis should not change the value of the integral, as the area below the graph is unchanged. To flip the integrand about the \\(y\\)-axis, we use the substitution \\(u=-x\\)$$I=\\int_{\\pi/4}^{-\\pi/4}\\frac{\\cos (-u)}{e^{-\\sin^3 u}+1}(-1)\\mathrm du=\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\frac{\\cos u}{e^{-\\sin^3 u}+1}\\,\\mathrm du=\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\frac{\\cos x}{e^{-\\sin^3 x}+1}\\,\\mathrm dx$$where \\(I\\) is the value of our desired integral. In definite integrals, the integration variable is merely a dummy variable. Hence, changing all occurences of \\(u\\) in the integral to \\(x\\) does not alter the value of \\(I\\). Therefore,$$\\begin{aligned}2I&amp;=\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\left(\\frac{\\cos x}{e^{\\sin^3 x}+1}+\\frac{\\cos x}{e^{-\\sin^3 x}+1}\\right)\\,\\mathrm dx\\\\&amp;=\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\left(\\frac{\\cos x}{e^{\\sin^3 x}+1}+\\frac{e^{\\sin^3x}\\cos x}{1+e^{\\sin^{3}x}}\\right)\\,\\mathrm dx\\\\&amp;=\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\frac{(1+e^{\\sin^3x})\\cos x}{1+e^{\\sin^3x}}\\,\\mathrm dx\\\\&amp;=\\int_{-\\pi/4}^{\\pi/4}\\cos x\\,\\mathrm dx\\\\&amp;=\\sqrt{2}\\end{aligned}$$Thus \\(I=\\frac{\\sqrt{2}}{2}\\). What if the interval of integration is not symmetric? Well, we can simply flip the integrand about the middle line of the interval of integration. We can state this generalization formally as the following lemma. Lemma 1. For \\(a,b\\in\\mathbf{R}\\) and an integrable function \\(f:[a,b]\\rightarrow\\mathbf R\\)$$\\int_a^bf(x)\\,\\mathrm{d}x=\\int_a^bf(a+b-x)\\,\\mathrm dx=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_{a}^b\\left(f(x)+f(a+b-x)\\right)\\,\\mathrm dx$$ I leave the proof of this lemma as an exercise for the reader. This lemma is trivial, but useful nevertheless. As another easy application of this lemma, consider the integral$$\\int_3^7\\frac{\\ln (x+2)}{\\ln (-x^2+10x+24)}\\,\\mathrm dx$$At first glance this integral seems nothing alike the previous one. Analysing the parity of the integrand does not seem to give us any valuable information. But after a careful inspection, we find that we can factorize part of the denominator of the integrand \\(-x^2+10x+24=(12-x)(x+2)\\), which gives away the hidden symmetry. By directly applying Lemma 1, we have$$\\begin{aligned}\\int_3^7\\frac{\\ln (x+2)}{\\ln (-x^2+10x+24)}\\,\\mathrm dx&amp;=\\int_3^7\\frac{\\ln (x+2)}{\\ln \\left[(12-x)(x+2)\\right]}\\,\\mathrm dx\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_3^7\\left(\\frac{\\ln (x+2)}{\\ln \\left[(12-x)(x+2)\\right]}+\\frac{\\ln (3+7-x+2)}{\\ln \\left[(12-(3+7-x))(3+7-x+2)\\right]}\\right)\\,\\mathrm dx\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_3^7\\left(\\frac{\\ln (x+2)}{\\ln \\left[(12-x)(x+2)\\right]}+\\frac{\\ln (12-x)}{\\ln \\left[(x+2)(12-x)\\right]}\\right)\\,\\mathrm dx\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_3^7\\frac{\\ln \\left[(x+2)(12-x)\\right]}{\\ln \\left[(x+2)(12-x)\\right]}\\,\\mathrm dx\\\\&amp;=\\frac{1}{2}\\int_3^7 1\\,\\mathrm dx\\\\&amp;=2\\end{aligned}$$And there you have it. There are many other integrals that take on such symmetries, and almost all of them can be solved very straightforwardly once you realize its symmetry. To give you an idea, try Exercise 1. Excercise 1. Evaluate \\(\\displaystyle\\int_0^{\\pi/4}\\ln(1+\\tan x)\\,\\mathrm dx\\) Evaluate \\(\\displaystyle \\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\frac{\\sin x+\\cos x}{1+\\sqrt[5]{\\tan x}}\\,\\mathrm dx\\) Evaluate \\(\\displaystyle\\int_{-\\pi}^\\pi\\frac{x^2}{ 1+\\sin x+\\sqrt{1+\\sin^2x}}\\,\\mathrm dx\\) Of course, you can simply apply Lemma 1 to each of these three integrals and solve them for free, but that would be no fun. Instead, I recommend pretending that you do not know Lemma 1, and solve the integrals by first pondering where the symmetry of the integrand lies. Exploiting the Symmetry of an Improper IntegralIn this section, we are talking about a different symmetry than the previous section: symmetry with respect to inversion. Consider the integral below, and maybe try it yourself before reading the next paragraph$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\\ln x}\\,\\mathrm dx$$Non-rigorously speaking, an improper integral over \\((0,\\infty)\\), after the substitution mapping \\(x\\mapsto 1/x\\), becomes an improper integral over \\((\\infty,0)\\); and an improper integral over \\((1,\\infty)\\), after the same substitution mapping, becomes a proper integral over \\((1,0)\\). Although it would be quite easy if you want to prove this formally, for now you can just think of it as a result of \\(1/0=\\infty\\) and \\(1/\\infty=0\\). By decomposing the intervals,$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\\ln x}\\,\\mathrm dx=\\int_0^1\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\\ln x}\\,\\mathrm dx+\\int_1^\\infty\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\\ln x}\\,\\mathrm dx$$Now that we have separated the original integral into two intergrals, focus on the latter of the two. The symmetry of it becomes clear once we apply the substitution \\(u=1/x\\),$$\\begin{aligned}\\int_1^\\infty\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\\ln x}\\,\\mathrm dx&amp;=-\\int_1^0\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+u^{-11}}{1+u^{-3}}}{u^2(1+u^{-2})\\ln u^{-1}}\\,\\mathrm du\\\\&amp;=-\\int_0^1\\frac{\\ln u^{-8}\\frac{1+u^{11}}{1+u^{3}}}{(u^2+1)\\ln u}\\,\\mathrm du\\\\&amp;=-\\int_0^1\\frac{-8\\ln u+\\ln\\frac{1+u^{11}}{1+u^{3}}}{(u^2+1)\\ln u}\\,\\mathrm du\\\\&amp;=8\\int_0^1\\frac{1}{u^2+1}\\,\\mathrm du-\\int_0^1\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\\ln x}\\,\\mathrm dx\\end{aligned}$$Same as the integral in the previous section, we replaced all occurences of \\(u\\) with \\(x\\), which does not change the value of the integral. Finally, we substitude this result to the first equation,$$\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{\\ln \\frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\\ln x}\\,\\mathrm dx=8\\int_0^1\\frac{1}{u^2+1}\\,\\mathrm du=2\\pi$$The final step is a trivial result from differentiating \\(\\arctan x\\), which I leave to you as an exercise. Generalizing the technique we used in this integral, we state the following lemma Lemma 2. For improperly integrable function \\(f:(0,\\infty)\\rightarrow\\mathbf R\\),$$\\int_0^\\infty f(x)\\,\\mathrm dx=\\int_0^\\infty\\frac{1}{x^2}f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\,\\mathrm dx=\\int_0^1\\left(f(x)+\\frac{1}{x^2}f\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\right)\\,\\mathrm dx$$ The proof of this lemma is left as an exercise for the reader. As another example, consider the integral,$$\\displaystyle\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\ln x}{1+x^2}\\,\\mathrm dx$$which is not too different from the previous integral. By applying Lemma 2,$$\\int_0^\\infty \\frac{\\ln x}{1+x^2}\\,\\mathrm dx=\\int_0^1\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{1+x^2}+\\frac{\\ln x^{-1}}{(1+x^{-2})x^2}\\right)\\,\\mathrm dx=\\int_0^1\\left(\\frac{\\ln x}{1+x^2}-\\frac{\\ln x}{1+x^2}\\right)\\,\\mathrm dx=0$$Moreover, Lemma 2 can be further generalized. Theorem 1. (Glasser’s Master Theorem) Let \\(f:\\mathbf{R}\\rightarrow \\mathbf{R}\\) be integrable and \\(a_1,\\dots,a_n,b_1,\\dots,b_n\\in\\mathbf{R}\\)$$\\mathrm{P}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(x)\\,\\mathrm dx=\\mathrm{P}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f\\left(x-\\sum_{j=1}^n\\frac{a_j}{x-b_{j}}\\right)\\,\\mathrm dx$$where \\(\\mathrm{P}\\) represent the Cauchy principle value of an double sided improper integral. A special case of the theorem is called the Cauchy–Schlömilch transform, namely$$\\mathrm{P}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f(x)\\,\\mathrm dx=\\mathrm{P}\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}f\\left(x-\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\\,\\mathrm dx$$where apparently \\(n=1\\) and \\(a_1=b_1=1\\). I am not going to prove this theorem, but I will provide examples of applications. Consider$$\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\sqrt{\\tan x}\\,\\mathrm du$$A simple substitution \\(u^2=\\tan x\\) gives us$$\\int_0^{\\pi/2}\\sqrt{\\tan x}\\,\\mathrm dx=\\int_0^{\\infty}u\\frac{2u}{1+u^4}\\,\\mathrm dx=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty}\\frac{u^2}{1+u^4}\\,\\mathrm dx$$To apply Cauchy-Schlömilch, all we need is a little algebraic manipulation,$$\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{u^{2} }{1+u^{4}}\\,\\mathrm du=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\mathrm d u}{\\left(u-1/u\\right)^{2}+2}=\\int_{-\\infty}^{\\infty} \\frac{\\mathrm d u}{u^{2}+2}=\\frac{\\pi}{\\sqrt{2}}$$If you want to read further on the Glasser’s Master Theorem, I recommend reading this paper, which generalizes the substitution to a meromorphic function \\(\\phi\\) with real simple poles \\(a_j\\) with \\(\\mathrm{Res}(a_j,\\phi)&lt;0\\), which would require the reader to have a basic understanding of complex analysis.

The proof of this result is surprisingly simple: to describe it briefly, multiply the first row by \\(-1\\) and add it to the \\(2,3,4,…,n\\) rows, multiply the second row by \\(-1\\) and add it to the \\(2,4,6,…\\) rows, multiply the third row by \\(-1\\) and add it to the \\(3,6,9,…\\) rows, and so on. Then use of the identity \\(\\sum_{d\\mid n}\\varphi(d)=n\\) to simplify.
