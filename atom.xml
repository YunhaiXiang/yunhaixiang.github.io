    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote class="pullquote"><p>“The language of categories is affectionately known as “abstract nonsense,” so named by Norman Steenrod. This term is essentially accurate and not necessarily derogatory: categories refer to “nonsense” in the sense that they are all about the “structure,” and not about the “meaning,” of what they represent.” </p><p><em>—Paolo Aluffi, Algebra: Chapter 0</em></p></blockquote><p>Introduced in the 1940s by Mac Lane and Eilenberg in a paper titled “General Theory of Natural Equivalences”, Category theory is a branch of mathematics that aims to unify various mathematical structures from different fields and provide generalized concepts and theorems, and is thus known for its abstractness and generality. In this post, I am going to explain two important concepts in category theory: the Yoneda Lemma and the universal property. I am assuming that the reader understands introductory abstract algebra (knows the definition of groups, rings, fields, vector spaces and modules) and perferably some topology. Throughout this post, we accept the Zermelo-Fraenkel axioms as our foundations, and use \(\mathcal{U}\) to refer to the universe of all sets. However, it should also be noted that there are other books relating category theory where the universe \(\mathcal{U}\) in discussion is not the universe of all set but rather something else such as the Grothendieck Universe, which is not a topic of discussion in this post.<br><a id="more"></a></p><blockquote><p>Definition 1. (Morphism) A <em>morphism</em> \(f\) from a class \(A\) to a class \(B\) is a triple \((A,B,S)\) where \(S\in\mathcal{U}\). </p></blockquote><p>The class \(A\) is the <em>source</em> of the morphism and \(B\) is the <em>target</em>. We use the notation \(A \stackrel{f}{\longrightarrow} B\) to denote that \(f\) is a morphism from \(A\) to \(B\). A morphism is simply a class that contains all information about its source and target and possibly additional information. A set \(S\) <em>as a morphism</em> from \(A\) to \(B\) is the morphism \((A,B,S)\). Let \(C\) be a class. For function \(f^\prime:A\rightarrow B\) as a morphism \(f\) from \(A\) to \(B\) and function \(g^\prime:B\rightarrow C\) as a morphism \(g\) from \(B\) to \(C\), we define their canonical composition \(g\circ f=(A,C,g^\prime \circ f^\prime)\) where \(g^\prime \circ f^\prime\) is the function composition of \(g^\prime\) and \(f^\prime\).</p><blockquote><p>Definition 2. (Category) A category \(\mathcal{C}\) consists of a class \(\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{C})\) whose elements are called the <em>objects</em>, a mapping \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}\) with domain \(\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{C})\times \mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{C})\) that maps \((A,B)\) to a class of morphisms from \(A\) to \(B\), and an operation \(\circ=\bigcup_{A,B,C\in\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{C})}\circ_{A,B,C}\) called the <em>composition</em> where<br>$$\circ_{A,B,C}:\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(B,C)\times \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)\rightarrow \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,C)<br>$$for all \(A,B,C\in\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{C})\), that satisfy the following two axioms,</p><ol><li>for all \(A,B,C,D\in\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{C})\) and for all \(f\in\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B),g\in\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(B,C),h\in\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(C,D)\)<br>$$h\circ (g\circ f)=(h\circ g)\circ f$$</li><li>for all \(X\in\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{C})\), there exists \(1_X\in\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,X)\) such that for all \(A,B\in\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{C})\) and \(f\in\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)\)<br>$$f\circ 1_A=1_B\circ f=f$$where we call \(1_X\) the <em>identity morphism</em> of \(X\).</li></ol><p>Moreover, A category \(\mathcal{C}\) is <em>locally small</em> if \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,B)\in \mathcal{U}\) for all \(A,B\in\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{C})\) and <em>small</em> if it is locally small and \(\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{C})\in\mathcal{U}\). Let \(\mathrm{Mor}(\mathcal{C}):=\mathrm{image}(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{c}})\) be the class of morphisms of the category \(\mathcal{C}\).</p></blockquote><p>In instances where it does not cause confusion, we usually omit the subscripts in \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}\) and simply write \(\mathrm{Hom}\). I should emphasize that morphisms need not be functions as morphisms. In fact, in a way, a category is a multigraph with an operation on its edges set that satisfies something similar to the two axioms in the above definition. If \(A,B\) are finite sets, then there are only finitely many functions from \(A\) to \(B\) set-theoretically speaking, but there are infinitely many morphisms from \(A\) to \(B\). In addition, we should consider \(\mathrm{Hom}(A,B)\) and \(\mathrm{Hom}(C,D)\) disjoint unless \(A=C\) and \(B=D\). </p><p>To give you an idea, here are some examples of categories</p><ol><li>The category \(\mathbf{Set}\) where \(\mathrm{obj}(\mathbf{Set})\) is the class of all sets, \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\textbf{Set}}(A,B)\) is the set functions from \(A\) to \(B\) as morphisms, and the composition \(\circ\) is the canonical composition. </li><li>The category \(\mathbf{Grp}\) where \(\mathrm{obj}(\mathbf{Grp})\) is the class of all groups, \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{Grp}}(A,B)\) is the set of group homomorphisms from \(A\) to \(B\) as morphisms, and the composition \(\circ\) is the canonical composition. </li><li>The category \(\mathbf{Ring}\) where \(\mathrm{obj}(\mathbf{Ring})\) is the class of all rings, \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{Ring}}(A,B)\) is the set of ring homomorphisms from \(A\) to \(B\) as morphisms, and the composition \(\circ\) is the canonical composition. </li><li>The category \(\mathbf{Ban}_{1}\) where \(\mathrm{obj}(\mathbf{Ban}_{1})\) is the class of all Banach spaces, \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{Ban}_{1}}(A,B)\) is the set of linear contractions from \(A\) to \(B\) as morphisms, and the composition \(\circ\) is the canonical composition. </li><li>The category \(\mathbf{Top}\) where \(\mathrm{obj}(\mathbf{Top})\) is the class of all topological spaces, \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{Top}}(A,B)\) is the set of continuous mappings from \(A\) to \(B\) as morphisms, and the composition \(\circ\) is the canonical composition. </li><li>The category \(\mathbf{Haus}\) where \(\mathrm{obj}(\mathbf{Haus})\) is the class of all Hausdorff topological spaces, \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{Haus}}(A,B)\) is the set of continuous mappings from \(A\) to \(B\) as morphisms, and the composition \(\circ\) is the canonical composition. </li><li>The category \(\mathbf{Pos}\) where \(\mathrm{obj}(\mathbf{Pos})\) is the class of all posets, \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathbf{Pos}}(A,B)\) is the set of order preserving mappings from \(A\) to \(B\) as morphisms, and the composition \(\circ\) is the canonical composition. </li></ol><p>Observe that in the above definitions, the terms “bijection” in sets, “isomorphism” in groups, rings and fields, “homeomorphism” in topologies, and “isometric bijective linear contraction” in Banach spaces are essentially the same thing when viewed from a higher angle: they are morphisms that preserve the structure and provide a one-to-one correspondance. Hence the definition,</p><blockquote><p>Definition 3. A morphism \(f\in\mathrm{Hom}(A,B)\) in some category with objects \(A,B,X\) is </p><ol><li>an <em>endomorphism</em> if \(A=B\).</li><li>a <em>monomorphism</em> if it is left-cancellable, i.e. \((f\circ g=f\circ h)\Longrightarrow (g=h)\) for all \(g,h\in\mathrm{Hom}(X,A)\).</li><li>an <em>epimorphism</em> if it is right-cancellable, i.e. \((g\circ f=h\circ f)\Longrightarrow (g=h)\) for all \(g,h\in\mathrm{Hom}(B,X)\).</li><li>a <em>split monomorphism</em> if it has a left inverse, i.e. there exist \(g\in\mathrm{Hom}(B,A)\) with \(g\circ f=1_A\)</li><li>a <em>split epimorphism</em> if it has a right inverse, i.e. there exist \(g\in\mathrm{Hom}(B,A)\) with \(f\circ g=1_B\)</li><li>a <em>bimorphism</em> if it is both a monomorphism and an epimorphism</li><li>an <em>isomorphism</em> if it is both a split monomorphism and a split epimorphism.</li><li>an <em>automorphism</em> if it is an isomorphism and an endomorphism.</li></ol><p>Moreover, we use the notations \(\mathrm{End}_{\mathcal{C}}(X)\) and \(\mathrm{Aut}_{\mathcal{C}}(X)\) (or \(\mathrm{End}(X)\) and \(\mathrm{Aut}(X)\) if it does not cause confusion) to denote the class of endomorphisms and automorphisms on the object \(X\) of the category \(\mathcal{C}\), and we write \(A\cong B\) to denote that the objects \(A\) and \(B\) are isomorphic.</p></blockquote><p>Monomorphisms and epimorphisms are generalizations of injections and surjections, and in fact the monomorphisms and epimorphisms in \(\mathbf{Set}\) are precisely the injections and surjections. It should be obvious to you that a split monomorphism is a monomorphism and a split epimorphism is an epimorphism, which means that an isomorphism is a bimorphism. However, a bimorphism is not necessaily an isomorphism. For example, the natural inclusion \(\mathbf{Z}\rightarrow\mathbf{Q}\) in the category \(\mathbf{Ring}\) is a bimorphism but not an isomorphism, and so are the natural inclusion \(\mathbf{Q}\rightarrow\mathbf{R}\) in the category \(\mathbf{Haus}\) and any non-identity morphism in the category \(\mathbf{Pos}\). Moreover, A small category where every morphism is an isomorphism is a <em>groupoid</em>. There is this joke that we can define a group as a groupoid with a single object, and it would make total sense mathematically, but “most mathematicians will find it ludicrous to introduce groups in this fasion, or they will at the very least politely express doubts on the pedagogical effectiveness of doing so”, as said by Paolo Aluffi.</p><p>Much like the morphisms in the previously mentioned categories, we can also define structure preserving maps between categories. In fact, the category \(\mathbf{Cat}\) is such that \(\mathrm{obj}(\mathbf{Cat})\) is the class of small categories, and for small categories \(\mathcal{A}\) and \(\mathcal{B}\), define \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\textbf{Cat}}(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B})\) as the class of functors from the category \(\mathcal{A}\) to the category \(\mathcal{B}\) as morphisms, where the notion of functors are defined as follows.<br><blockquote><p>Definition 4. (Functors) Let \(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}\) be categories. A (covariant) functor \(\mathrm{F}\) from \(\mathcal{A}\) to \(\mathcal{B}\) is a pair of functions \((\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{obj}},\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{hom}})\) such that \(\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{obj}}:\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{A})\rightarrow \mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{B})\) and \(\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{hom}}:\mathrm{Mor}(\mathcal{A})\rightarrow \mathrm{Mor}(\mathcal{B})\) and for all \(X,Y,Z\in\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{A})\)</p><ol><li>\(\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{hom}}(1_X)=1_{\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{obj}}(X)}\) </li><li>if \(f\in\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(X,Y)\) then \(\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{hom}}(f)\in\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{B}}(\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{obj}}(X),\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{obj}}(Y))\)</li><li>\(\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{hom}}(g\circ_{\mathcal{A}} f)=\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{hom}}(g)\circ_{\mathcal{B}} \mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{hom}}(f)\) for all \(f\in\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(X,Y)\) and \(g\in\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(Y,Z)\)</li></ol><p>where \(\circ_{\mathcal{A}},\circ_{\mathcal{B}}\) represents the composition operation in the categories \(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}\) respectively. Moreover, the composition of two functors \(\mathrm{F}\circ \mathrm{G}\) is the pairwise composition of their object function and morphism function, i.e. \(\mathrm{F}\circ\mathrm{G}=(\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{obj}}\circ \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{obj}},\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{hom}}\circ \mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{hom}})\).</p></blockquote>Before I provide some examples of functors, I should introduce a few new concepts. If \(\mathcal{C}\) is a category, then its <em>opposite category</em> is the category \(\mathcal{C}^{\textrm{op}}\) where \(\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{C}^{\textrm{op}})=\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{C})\) and \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}^{\textrm{op}}}(A,B)=\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(B,A)\). If \(\mathcal{A},\mathcal{B}\) are categories, a <em>contravariant</em> functor from \(\mathcal{A}\) to \(\mathcal{B}\) is a functor from \(\mathcal{A}^{\mathrm{op}}\) to \(\mathcal{B}\). A <em>presheaf</em> on a category \(\mathcal{C}\) is a contravariant functor from \(\mathcal{C}\) to \(\mathbf{Set}\). <!--- The product \\(\mathcal{A}\times\mathcal{B}\\) of the two categories is the category where \\(\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{A}\times \mathcal{B})=\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{A})\times \mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{B})\\) and the morphisms \\(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}\times \mathcal{B}}((A_1,B_1),(A_2,B_2))=\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(A_1,A_2)\times \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{B}}(B_1,B_2)\\).--> Finally, here are the examples,</p><ol><li>the identity functor \(1_{\mathcal{C}}\) from \(\mathcal{C}\) to \(\mathcal{C}\) with \(1_{\mathcal{C}}^{\textrm{obj}}:X\mapsto X\) and \(1_{\mathcal{C}}^{\textrm{hom}}:f\mapsto f\)</li><li>the constant functor \(\Delta_{X}\) from \(\mathcal{A}\) to \(\mathcal{B}\) with \(\Delta_{X}^{\mathrm{obj}}:A\mapsto X\) and \(\Delta_{X}^{\mathrm{hom}}:f\mapsto 1_X\) where \(X\in\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{B})\)</li><li>the functor \(\mathrm{F}\) from \(\mathbf{Grp}\) to \(\mathbf{Set}\) with \(\mathrm{F}^{\textrm{obj}}:(G,\cdot)\mapsto G\) and \(\mathrm{F}^{\textrm{hom}}:f\mapsto f\). Functors as such are called <em>forgetful</em> functors, since it forgets its operation. We can also construct forgetful functors from \(\mathbf{Ring}\) to \(\mathbf{Grp}\), and ones from \(\mathbf{Top}\) to \(\mathbf{Set}\), and so on. There is no precise definition for a forgetful functor</li><li>the functor \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,-)\) from a locally small category \(\mathcal{C}\), where \(A\in\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{C})\), to the category \(\mathbf{Set}\), such that the mappings \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,-)^{\mathrm{obj}}:X\mapsto \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,X)\) and \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(A,-)^{\mathrm{hom}}:f\mapsto (f\circ -)\) where \(f\circ -\) is the mapping \(g\mapsto f\circ g\) as a morphism. Similarly, we define a presheaf \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(-,B)\) of \(\mathcal{C}\) where \(B\in\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{C})\), such that the mappings \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(-,B)^{\mathrm{obj}}:X\mapsto \mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(X,B)\) and \(\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{C}}(-,B)^{\mathrm{hom}}:f\mapsto (-\circ f)\) where \(-\circ f\) is the mapping \(g\mapsto g\circ f\) as a morphism. These two functor are called the covariant and contravariant <em>hom-functors</em>. Moreover, any functor that is isomorphic to a hom-functor in \(\mathbf{Cat}\) is a <em>representable functor</em>.</li></ol><p>Informally, we use the term “diagram” to refer to a multi-directed-graph, or a quiver, with vertices are objects and edges as morphisms to represent part of a category and a composition for edges. We use different notations for different kinds of morphisms: a hooked arrow \(\hookrightarrow\) to represent a monomorphism, and a double arrow \(\twoheadrightarrow\) for epimorphisms.</p><blockquote><p>Let \(\mathrm{F}\) be a functor from \(\mathcal{A}\) to \(\mathcal{B}\).

A <em>natural transformation</em> \(\alpha\) from \(\mathrm{F}\) to \(\mathrm{G}\) is mapping \(\alpha:\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{A})\rightarrow \mathrm{Mor}(\mathcal{B})\) with \(\alpha:X\mapsto \alpha_X\) such that \(\alpha_{X}\in\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{B}}(\mathrm{F}^{\mathrm{obj}}(X),\mathrm{G}^{\mathrm{obj}}(X))\) and the following diagram commutes for all \(A,B\in\mathrm{obj}(\mathcal{A})\) and for all \(f\in\mathrm{Hom}_{\mathcal{A}}(A,B)\)<br>We use \(\alpha:\mathrm{F}\Rightarrow \mathrm{G}\) to denote \(\alpha\) is a natural transformation from \(\mathrm{F}\) to \(\mathrm{G}\), and we say that \(\alpha_X\) is a <em>component</em> of \(\alpha\) at \(X\).

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Burnside’s lemma is a lemma of elementary group theory that is very useful in counting, and often seen as an “overkill” trick in math competitions. Intuitively, Burnside’s lemma counts the number of arrangements or permutations of an object if some of its symmetries are considered identical. For example, </p><blockquote><p>Example 1. </p><p>How many distinct colorings can be obtained with \(6\) different colors to color the faces of a cube?

      &lt;p&gt;Burnside’s lemma is a lemma of elementary group theory that is very useful in counting, and often seen as an “overkill” trick in math competitions. Intuitively, Burnside’s lemma counts the number of arrangements or permutations of an object if some of its symmetries are considered identical. For example, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Example 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many distinct colorings can be obtained with \(6\) different colors to color the faces of a cube? Two configurations are considered identical if one can be obtained from the other through rotation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&quot;spoiler collapsed&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spoiler-title&quot;&gt;Solution&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;spoiler-content&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;There are \(30\) distinct colorings. Consider the group of rotations of a cube \(G\) acting on \(\mathrm{S}_6\), there are \(3\times 3=9\) rotations about opposite faces, \(6\times 1 = 6\) rotations about opposite edges, and \(4\times 2=8\) rotations about opposite vertices. Together with the identity rotation we have \(|G|=9+6+8+1=24\) (in fact, \(G\) is isomorphic to \(\mathrm{S}_4 \)). For \(g=e\), we have \(X^g=X\), and for \(g\ne e\), we have \(X^g=\varnothing\) since all colors on the faces are different. Hence the number of orbits is&lt;br&gt;$$&lt;br&gt;\frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G}|X^g|=\frac{|X|}{|G|}=\frac{6!}{24}=30&lt;br&gt;$$which means that there are \(30\) distinct colorings.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To approach such problem, we start with the definitions of orbits, stabilizers, and fixed points in group actions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Definition 1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let \(G\) be a group that acts on \(X\), the &lt;strong&gt;orbit&lt;/strong&gt; of a point \( x\in X\) is defined as \( G\cdot x=\{g\cdot x\mid g\in G\}  \), the &lt;strong&gt;stabilizer&lt;/strong&gt; of a point \( x\in X\) is defined as \( G_x =\{g\in G\mid g\cdot x=x\} \), and the &lt;strong&gt;fixed points&lt;/strong&gt; of \(g\in G\) in \(X\) is the set \( X^g=\{x\in X\mid g\cdot x=x\} \). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that for \(x,y\in X\), either the orbits \(G\cdot x=G\cdot y\) or \((G\cdot x)\cap (G\cdot y)=\varnothing \). This is an easy result since if \(a\in (G\cdot x)\cap (G\cdot y)\) then \(a=g_1\cdot x=g_2\cdot y\), for some \(g_1,g_2\in G\), so \(x=g_1^{-1}g_2\cdot y\) and \(y=g_2^{-1}g_1\cdot x\), hence \((G\cdot x)\subseteq (G\cdot y)\) and \((G\cdot y)\subseteq (G\cdot x)\). Also, consider the map \(\varphi:G/G_x\rightarrow G\cdot x\) defined by \(\varphi(gG_x)=g\cdot x\). We can easily see that \(\varphi\) is an isomorphism, which gives us \(|G\cdot x|=\left[G:G_x\right]\), also known as the orbit-stabilizer theorem.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post is my collection of obscure, rare, or asthetically pleasing integral tricks. Some of them use clever substitutions, others exploit the symmetry of the integrand, or make use of some devilishly sly maneuvers such as differentiating under the integral sign.  For a quick appetizer, try evaluate<br>$$<br>\int_0^\pi\ln(a^2-2a\cos x+1)\,\mathrm d x<br>$$where \(a&gt;0\). This is one of my favorite integrals. We will see later in this post that this integral can be solved by at least <em>five</em> different methods, which is simply astounding! I should clearify that not all of these tricks are meant to be pragmatic, and the vast majority of tricks in this collection are for recreational mathematics. The integral tricks in this collection mainly comes from past papers of math olympiads such as the Putnam, PUMaC, HMMT and SMT, as well as online math communities like <a href="https://math.stackexchange.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Math Stack Exchange</a> and <a href="https://artofproblemsolving.com/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Art of Problem Solving</a>. For further reading, I really recommend the book <a href="https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781493912766" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Inside Interesting Integrals</em></a> by Paul J. Nahin, who does a better job of summarizing integral tricks than I do. Now, without further ado, let’s take a look at the first trick.</p><a id="more"></a><hr><h4 id="Exploiting-the-Symmetry-of-the-Integrand"><a href="#Exploiting-the-Symmetry-of-the-Integrand" class="headerlink" title="Exploiting the Symmetry of the Integrand"></a>Exploiting the Symmetry of the Integrand</h4><p>In many cases, mathematics tends to reward you when you respect its symmetry, and when it comes to integrals, sometimes we can exploit the hidden symmetries in the integrand. Case in point, consider the following integral, which I really recommend you to solve yourself before reading the next paragraph</p><p>$$\int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\frac{\cos x}{e^{\sin^3 x}+1}\,\mathrm dx$$Observe that the interval of integration is symmetric, and the numerator of the integrad \(\cos x\) is an even function while \(\sin^3 x\) in the denominator is odd. Hence, if we take mirror the graph of the integrand with respect to the \(y\)-axis, the resulting function should only differ by a negative sign before \(\sin^3 x\). And since the interval of integration is symmetric, flipping the integrand about the \(y\)-axis should not change the value of the integral, as the area below the graph is unchanged.  To flip the integrand about the \(y\)-axis, we use the substitution \(u=-x\)<br>$$\mathcal{I}=\int_{\pi/4}^{-\pi/4}\frac{\cos (-u)}{e^{-\sin^3 u}+1}(-1)\mathrm du=\int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\frac{\cos u}{e^{-\sin^3 u}+1}\,\mathrm du=\int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\frac{\cos x}{e^{-\sin^3 x}+1}\,\mathrm dx$$where \(\mathcal I\) is the value of our desired integral. In definite integrals, the integration variable  is merely a dummy variable. Hence, changing all occurences of \(u\) in the integral to \(x\) does not alter the value of \(\mathcal I\). Therefore,<br>$$<br>\begin{aligned}<br>2\mathcal{I}&amp;=\int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\left(\frac{\cos x}{e^{\sin^3 x}+1}+\frac{\cos x}{e^{-\sin^3 x}+1}\right)\,\mathrm dx\\<br>&amp;=\int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\left(\frac{\cos x}{e^{\sin^3 x}+1}+\frac{e^{\sin^3x}\cos x}{1+e^{\sin^{3}x}}\right)\,\mathrm dx\\<br>&amp;=\int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\frac{(1+e^{\sin^3x})\cos x}{1+e^{\sin^3x}}\,\mathrm dx\\<br>&amp;=\int_{-\pi/4}^{\pi/4}\cos x\,\mathrm dx\\<br>&amp;=\sqrt{2}<br>\end{aligned}<br>$$Thus \(\mathcal{I}=\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}\). What if the interval of integration is not symmetric? Well, we can simply flip the integrand about the middle line of the interval of integration. We can state this generalization formally as the following lemma.</p><blockquote><p>Lemma 1. For \(a,b\in\mathbf{R}\) and an integrable function \(f:[a,b]\rightarrow\mathbf R\)<br>$$<br>\int_a^bf(x)\,\mathrm{d}x=\int_a^bf(a+b-x)\,\mathrm dx=\frac{1}{2}\int_{a}^b\left(f(x)+f(a+b-x)\right)\,\mathrm dx<br>$$</p></blockquote><p>I leave the proof of this lemma as an exercise for the reader. This lemma is trivial, but useful nevertheless. As another easy application of this lemma, consider the integral<br>$$<br>\int_3^7\frac{\ln (x+2)}{\ln (-x^2+10x+24)}\,\mathrm dx<br>$$At first glance this integral seems nothing alike the previous one. Analysing the parity of the integrand does not seem to give us any valuable information. But after a careful inspection, we find that we can factorize part of the denominator of the integrand \(-x^2+10x+24=(12-x)(x+2)\), which gives away the hidden symmetry. By directly applying Lemma 1, we have<br>$$<br>\begin{aligned}<br>\int_3^7\frac{\ln (x+2)}{\ln (-x^2+10x+24)}\,\mathrm dx<br>&amp;=\int_3^7\frac{\ln (x+2)}{\ln \left[(12-x)(x+2)\right]}\,\mathrm dx\\<br>&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\int_3^7\left(\frac{\ln (x+2)}{\ln \left[(12-x)(x+2)\right]}+\frac{\ln (3+7-x+2)}{\ln \left[(12-(3+7-x))(3+7-x+2)\right]}\right)\,\mathrm dx\\<br>&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\int_3^7\left(\frac{\ln (x+2)}{\ln \left[(12-x)(x+2)\right]}+\frac{\ln (12-x)}{\ln \left[(x+2)(12-x)\right]}\right)\,\mathrm dx\\<br>&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\int_3^7\frac{\ln \left[(x+2)(12-x)\right]}{\ln \left[(x+2)(12-x)\right]}\,\mathrm dx\\<br>&amp;=\frac{1}{2}\int_3^7 1\,\mathrm dx\\<br>&amp;=2<br>\end{aligned}<br>$$And there you have it. There are many other integrals that take on such symmetries, and almost all of them can be solved very straightforwardly once you realize its symmetry. To give you an idea, try Exercise 1. </p><blockquote><p>Excercise 1. </p><ol><li>Evaluate \(\displaystyle\int_0^{\pi/4}\ln(1+\tan x)\,\mathrm dx\)</li><li>Evaluate \(\displaystyle \int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{\sin x+\cos x}{1+\sqrt[5]{\tan x}}\,\mathrm dx\)</li><li>Evaluate \(\displaystyle\int_{-\pi}^\pi\frac{x^2}{ 1+\sin x+\sqrt{1+\sin^2x}}\,\mathrm dx\)</li></ol></blockquote><p>Of course, you can simply apply Lemma 1 to each of these three integrals and solve them for free, but that would be no fun. Instead, I recommend pretending that you do not know Lemma 1, and solve the integrals by first pondering where the symmetry of the integrand lies.</p><hr><h4 id="Exploiting-the-Symmetry-of-an-Improper-Integral"><a href="#Exploiting-the-Symmetry-of-an-Improper-Integral" class="headerlink" title="Exploiting the Symmetry of an Improper Integral"></a>Exploiting the Symmetry of an Improper Integral</h4><p>In this section, we are talking about a different symmetry than the previous section: symmetry with respect to inversion. Consider the integral below, and maybe try it yourself before reading the next paragraph<br>$$<br>\int_0^\infty\frac{\ln \frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\ln x}\,\mathrm dx<br>$$Non-rigorously speaking, an improper integral over \((0,\infty)\), after the substitution mapping \(x\mapsto 1/x\), becomes an improper integral over \((\infty,0)\); and an improper integral over \((1,\infty)\), after the same substitution mapping, becomes a proper integral over \((1,0)\). Although it would be quite easy if you want to prove this formally, for now you can just think of it as a result of \(1/0=\infty\) and \(1/\infty=0\). By decomposing the intervals,<br>$$<br>\int_0^\infty\frac{\ln \frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\ln x}\,\mathrm dx=\int_0^1\frac{\ln \frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\ln x}\,\mathrm dx+\int_1^\infty\frac{\ln \frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\ln x}\,\mathrm dx<br>$$Now that we have separated the original integral into two intergrals, focus on the latter of the two. The symmetry of it becomes clear once we apply the substitution \(u=1/x\),<br>$$<br>\begin{aligned}<br>\int_1^\infty\frac{\ln \frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\ln x}\,\mathrm dx&amp;=-\int_1^0\frac{\ln \frac{1+u^{-11}}{1+u^{-3}}}{u^2(1+u^{-2})\ln u^{-1}}\,\mathrm du\\<br>&amp;=-\int_0^1\frac{\ln u^{-8}\frac{1+u^{11}}{1+u^{3}}}{(u^2+1)\ln u}\,\mathrm du\\<br>&amp;=-\int_0^1\frac{-8\ln u+\ln\frac{1+u^{11}}{1+u^{3}}}{(u^2+1)\ln u}\,\mathrm du\\<br>&amp;=8\int_0^1\frac{1}{u^2+1}\,\mathrm du-\int_0^1\frac{\ln \frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\ln x}\,\mathrm dx<br>\end{aligned}<br>$$Same as the integral in the previous section, we replaced all occurences of \(u\) with \(x\), which does not change the value of the integral. Finally, we substitude this result to the first equation,<br>$$<br>\int_0^\infty\frac{\ln \frac{1+x^{11}}{1+x^3}}{(1+x^2)\ln x}\,\mathrm dx=8\int_0^1\frac{1}{u^2+1}\,\mathrm du=2\pi<br>$$The final step is a trivial result from differentiating \(\arctan x\), which I leave to you as an exercise. Generalizing the technique we used in this integral, we state the following lemma</p><blockquote><p>Lemma 2. For improperly integrable function \(f:(0,\infty)\rightarrow\mathbf R\),<br>$$<br>\int_0^\infty f(x)\,\mathrm dx=\int_0^\infty\frac{1}{x^2}f\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\,\mathrm dx=\int_0^1\left(f(x)+\frac{1}{x^2}f\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)\right)\,\mathrm dx$$</p></blockquote><p>The proof of this lemma is left as an exercise for the reader. As another example, consider the integral,<br>$$<br>\displaystyle\int_0^\infty \frac{x^{\alpha}\ln^3 x}{(1+x^2)(1+x^{\alpha})^2}\,\mathrm dx<br>$$where \(\alpha\in\mathbf R\), which is not too different from the previous integral. Note that in both these integrals, the integrand is a multiple of \(\frac{1}{1+x^2}\), since it has the convinient property of \(\frac{1}{1+x^2}=\frac{1}{(1+x^{-2})x^2}\). You can check that this also works for \(\frac{1}{(1+x)^2}\). Thus, we can solve this integral in a similar fasion, by substitution \(u=1/x\)<br>$$<br>\begin{aligned}<br>\int_0^\infty \frac{x^{\alpha}\ln^3 x}{(1+x^2)(1+x^{\alpha})^2}\,\mathrm dx&amp;=\int_{\infty}^0\frac{u^{-\alpha}\ln^3 u^{-1}}{(1+u^{-2})(1+u^{-\alpha})^2}\left(-\frac{1}{u^2}\right)\,\mathrm du\\<br>&amp;=-\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{u^{-\alpha}\ln^3 u}{(1+u^2)(1+u^{-\alpha})^2}\cdot\frac{u^{2\alpha}}{u^{2\alpha}}\,\mathrm du\\<br>&amp;=-\int_{0}^{\infty}\frac{u^{\alpha}\ln^3 u}{(1+u^2)(1+u^{\alpha})^2}\,\mathrm du<br>\end{aligned}<br>$$We find that the integral is the same as its additive inverse, which means that the integral has a constant value \(0\) for all \(\alpha\). In fact, we can extend this technique of exploiting the symmetry of inversion to double sided improper integrals, which is known as Glasser’s Master Theorem.</p><blockquote><p>Theorem 1. (Glasser’s Master Theorem) Let \(f:\mathbf{R}\rightarrow \mathbf{R}\) be integrable and \(a_1,\dots,a_n,b_1,\dots,b_n\in\mathbf{R}\)<br>$$<br>\mathrm{P}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)\,\mathrm dx=\mathrm{P}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f\left(x-\sum_{j=1}^n\frac{a_j}{x-b_{j}}\right)\,\mathrm dx<br>$$where \(\mathrm{P}\) represent the Cauchy principle value of an double sided improper integral. A special case of the theorem is called the Cauchy–Schlömilch transform, namely<br>$$<br>\mathrm{P}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f(x)\,\mathrm dx=\mathrm{P}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}f\left(x-\frac{1}{x}\right)\,\mathrm dx<br>$$where apparently \(n=1\) and \(a_1=b_1=1\).</p></blockquote><p>I will not prove this theorem, but I will provide examples of applications. Consider<br>$$<br>\int_0^{\pi/2}\sqrt{\tan x}\,\mathrm du<br>$$This isn’t really an improper integral, but it cannot be solved straightforwardly either. To get rid of the square root, it is necessary to turn this proper integral into an improper one. A simple substitution \(u^2=\tan x\) do the trick. After that, to apply Cauchy-Schlömilch, all we need is a little algebraic manipulation,<br>$$<br>\begin{aligned}<br>\int_0^{\pi/2}\sqrt{\tan x}\,\mathrm dx&amp;=\int_0^{\infty}u\frac{2u}{1+u^4}\,\mathrm dx\\<br>&amp;=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty}\frac{u^2}{1+u^4}\,\mathrm du\\<br>&amp;=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\mathrm d u}{\left(u-1/u\right)^{2}+2}\\<br>&amp;=\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} \frac{\mathrm d u}{u^{2}+2}\\<br>&amp;=\frac{\pi}{\sqrt{2}}<br>\end{aligned}<br>$$If you want to read further on the Glasser’s Master Theorem, I recommend reading <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1004.2445.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this</a> paper, which generalizes the substitution to a meromorphic function \(\phi\) with real simple poles \(a_j\) with \(\mathrm{Res}(a_j,\phi)&lt;0\), but it would require the reader to have a basic understanding of complex analysis. For exercise 2, you will not need any knowledge about Glasser’s Master Theorem or Cauchy-Schlömilch transformation.</p><blockquote><p>Excercise 2. </p><ol><li>Evaluate \(\displaystyle\int_0^\infty \frac{\ln x}{x^2+2x+4}\,\mathrm dx\)</li><li>Evaluate \(\displaystyle\int_0^{\pi/2}\frac{\mathrm dx}{1+\tan^\alpha x}\) where \(\alpha\ge 0\)</li><li>Evaluate \(\displaystyle \int_0^\infty\frac{x-1}{\sqrt{2^x-1} \ln\left(2^x-1\right)}\,\mathrm dx\) </li></ol></blockquote><hr><h4 id="Feynmann’s-Trick"><a href="#Feynmann’s-Trick" class="headerlink" title="Feynmann’s Trick"></a>Feynmann’s Trick</h4><blockquote><p>Theorem 2.

For further reading, I really recommend the book &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781493912766&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;noopener&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inside Interesting Integrals&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; by Paul J. Nahin, who does a better job of summarizing integral tricks than I do. Now, without further ado, let’s take a look at the first trick.&lt;/p&gt;
